---> What is OpenCV?
OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision Library) is a library (set of functions and tools) for computer vision and image processing.
It allows computers to see, understand, and process images or videos, just like humans do with their eyes.

---> What can OpenCV do?
Some common things you can do with OpenCV:

- Image processing → resize, crop, rotate, blur, sharpen images.
- Object detection → detect faces, eyes, cars, or even custom objects.
- Video analysis → track moving objects, count people, analyze motion.
- OCR support → read text from images (when combined with Tesseract).
- AI & ML integration → used in deep learning projects for preprocessing images.

---> Real-world examples:

Face unlock on your phone → uses OpenCV + AI.
Self-driving cars → detect lanes, traffic lights, pedestrians using OpenCV.
Medical imaging → analyzing X-rays or MRI scans.
Industrial automation → checking product defects in factories.
